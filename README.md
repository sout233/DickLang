this is a "dick" language created by csharp and ANTLR4.

i won't how to make a AST so i use the ANTLR4.Runtime.Standrad.

this is just a bastard language, and draws on many modern programming languages.

the feature it has:

- use 'dick' to declare variables
- use 'dick nig' to declare immutable variables
- use 'fu*k' to defined function
- basic expressions (like 1+1=3)
- some control flow statements (if, if-else, until, until-else, etc.)
